<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="look at my computer" tags="" position="255,403">You read some buzzfeed articles. This is a prototype, so there&#39;s not a lot of flavor text.

[[wait]].
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="wait" tags="" position="406,307">Your boyfriend comes in. He&#39;s not a very nice guy. In fact, he&#39;s pretty abusive. He strangles you. You die. When this is drawn out with sprites, it will be much more emotional.

Your spirit floats up and you can see your body in front of you. You&#39;re now a ghost!

You see your boyfriend rearranging your body. He takes out a rope and ties it around your neck, then hangs your body from a pipe in the ceiling. &quot;The perfect suicide&quot;, you hear him say. He then leaves the room.

While you&#39;re a ghost (spoiler alert: the whole rest of the game), you can hear living people talk. They can&#39;t see you, so this means you can eavesdrop on conversations. Being a ghost, you can also walk through walls.

In a non-twine version, the game will be 2D, and the camera will be looking down on the floor plan of your dorm. You can move between rooms and go through walls with the WASD keys or by clicking. In this version, though, you can only do a couple things.

Because you&#39;re a ghost, you can&#39;t do a lot of things with the computer.

<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="read my diary" tags="" position="255,199">Your diary has all the details of how terrible your boyfriend is. Why are you even with him, anyway? (because abusive people make it hard to leave a relationship with them)

You can, in general, interact with inanimate objects. You can do things like knock them over, lift them, and so on. You know, the kind of stuff you see on paranormal television shows.
